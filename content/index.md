# The Love of God

> "_God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them._" — 1 John 4:16

## God's Unconditional Love

God’s love is **unconditional**, meaning it is given freely, without any expectation or condition. Unlike human love, which can be based on circumstances, God's love remains constant. Here are some Scriptural references:

- John 3:16 – "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son..."
- Romans 5:8 – "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

### Key Points

1. **Unconditional Acceptance** - God loves each person regardless of their past or present.
2. **Sacrificial Love** - The ultimate expression of God's love is in the sacrifice of Jesus.
3. **Everlasting Love** - God's love endures forever and is present in every part of life.

## Callouts and Highlights

## Practical Reflections

We can understand God's love in three distinct ways:

- **Through Nature** - Observing creation can reveal God’s care and intentionality.
- **Through Scripture** - Reading about the life of Jesus illustrates God’s love in action.
- **Through Community** - Experiencing God’s love through fellowship with others.

## Code Block (For Reflection)

Sometimes it helps to use a code block to highlight points for reflection:

> [!question]
> # Reflection on Love
> 1. How has God shown His love in your life?
> 2. How can you reflect God’s love to others?
> 3. In what ways does the love of God bring peace and comfort?
